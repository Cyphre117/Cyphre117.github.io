# The Elements of Eloquence

## Alliteration
Words starting with the same letter.

> Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,  
> He bravely broached his boiling bloody breast;  
> _~ Shakespeare, Midsomer Night's Dream_

## Polyptoton
Repeating the same word, possibly with different meanings.

> That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.  
> _~ Neil Armstrong_  

The words don't have to be exactly the same, step + leap, man + mankind.

> tut, tut!  
> Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:  
> I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace'  
> In an ungracious mouth is but profane.  
> _~ Shakespear, Richard II_

## Antithesis
First you mention one thing: then you mention another. Some say use a colon. Others say use a full stop.

> The well-bred contradict other people. The wise contradict themselves.  
> _~ Oscar Wilde_

A long succession of antithesis is called a progressio

> It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the  
> age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch  
> of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of  
> Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it  
> was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had  
> nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were  
> all going direct the other way ...  
> _~ Chales Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities_

## Merism
Merism is when rather than naming what you are talking about, you name it's parts. Ladies and Gentlemen being a merism for people.

## The Blazon
A long list of merism with a simile attached to each part.

## Synaesthesia
> She smelled the way the Taj Mahal looks by moonlight.  
> _~   Raymond Chandler, The Little Sister_
